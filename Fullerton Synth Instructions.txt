Fullerton Synth Instructions* Ensure all files (FullertonSynth_voice.maxpat, Fullterton Synthesiser.amxd and nw.gverb~.mxe) are all located in the same place.* I recommend installing LowkeyNW Max Package (https://cycling74.com/tools/lowkeynw-max-package) to ensure the reverb functions.* When you load the synthesiser press the default settings button Ð this is due to a minor bug in Max for Live.* If you are saving via collect all and save you need to ensure all files are located in the Ableton project file or the synthesiser will cease to work.
